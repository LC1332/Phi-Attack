If the bakery sold a total of 50 items and made $80, how many muffins did they sell?\n\nSolution:\nLet's assume the number of muffins sold is x.\nThe number of cookies sold is 50 - x (since the total number of items sold is 50).\nThe total revenue from muffins is 2x dollars.\nThe total revenue from cookies is 1.50(50 - x) dollars.\nAccording to the problem, the total revenue is $80.\nSo, we can write the equation:\n2x + 1.50(50 - x) = 80\nSimplifying the equation:\n2x + 75 - 1.50x = 80\n0.50x + 75 = 80\nSubtracting 75 from both sides:\n0.50x = 5\nD"}

If a customer buys 10 apples, how much will they pay?\n\nSolution:\nTo find the total cost, we need to multiply the price of each apple by the number of apples bought.\n\nGiven:\nPrice of each apple = $0.50\nNumber of apples bought = 10\n\nTotal cost = Price of each apple * Number of apples bought\nTotal cost = $0.50 * 10\nTotal cost = $5.00\n\nTherefore, the customer will pay $5.00 for 10 apples.\n<|endoftext|>\n\n\nQuestion 1: A store sells apples for $0"}

In this section, we will learn about the re.sub() function and its parameters.\n\nThe re.sub() function is used to replace a pattern in a string with another string. It takes three parameters: the pattern to be replaced, the string to replace it with, and the string to replace the pattern with. The pattern can contain special characters that have a special meaning in regular expressions.\n\nLet's take an example to understand this better. Suppose we have a string \"Hello, World!\". We want to replace all occurrences of the word \"World\" with \"Python\". We can use the re.sub() function to achieve this.\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ntext ="}
