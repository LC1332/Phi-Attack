If a customer buys 4 apples and 3 oranges, how much does the customer spend in total?\n\nSolution:\nTo find the total amount spent, we need to calculate the cost of the apples and oranges separately and then add them together.\n\nCost of apples = 4 apples * $0.50/apple = $2.00\nCost of oranges = 3 oranges * $0.75/orange = $2.25\n\nTotal amount spent = Cost of apples + Cost of oranges = $2.00 + $2.25 = $4.25\n<|endoftext|>\n\n\nQuestion 1: A store sells apples for $0.50 each and oranges for $0.75 each.
